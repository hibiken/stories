This project is a fork of a Medium clone which began as [Ken Hibino](https://github.com/kenny-hibino “Ken Hibino”)'s personal side project to learn **Ruby on Rails** and **ReactJS**. I've upgraded and refactored some part of the rails app and I've integrated Dante2 wysiwyg editor.

## The specific improvements from the original repository:

### Platform 

+ Rails 5.2.1 update!
+ Removed elastisearch-rails , replaced by searchkick
+ Removed carrierwave, replaced by activestorge
+ Webpacker added
+ Updated dependencies
+ Replaced phantomJs by chrome-webdriver
+ Ruby version 2.4.0
+ Works with Elasticsearch 6.3.X

### Application Model

+ multiple image support
+ Oembed support
+ A better wysiwyg With Dante2 Draftjs
  + Code blocks with language formatting via Prism-js
  + A video record component to build posts with recorded video
  + Database saves a serialized representation of text
  + And much much more
+ Automatic title detection
+ Lead Text is automatic too. more performant approach , I think
+ Responses are unified as a Post model, so Response model is removed
