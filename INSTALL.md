# Step by Step - Install & Configuration

## System dependencies

* PostgreSQL
* Elasticsearch
* Redis
* Ruby version 2.3.0
* Rails

# Lets Get Started!

**1. Install Homebrew**

Homebrew allows us to install and compile software packages easily from source.

Run the following command in the Terminal. When it asks you to install Xcode CommandLine Tools, say yes

```ruby -e “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)”```

**2. Instal Ruby**

```
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a Terminal

```
echo ‘if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval “$(rbenv init -)”; fi’ >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Install Ruby 2.3.0 which is required by the app:

```
rbenv install 2.3.0
rbenv global 2.3.0
ruby -v
```

**3. Install Rails**

Installing Rails is really simple:

```
gem install rails -v 4.2.4
rbenv rehash
rails -v
```


**4. Install PostgreSQL**

```
brew install postgresql
```

Make sure to follow those instructions of the build notes.

If your installing PostgreSQL for the first time create a database:

```
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8
```

Lunchy is a helpful gem that will allow you to easily start and stop Postgres.

```
gem install lunchy
```

Change the version number of PostgreSQL to the version that you installed:

```
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/0.0.0/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
```

To Stop PostgreSQL run:
```
lunchy stop postgres
```

We want it to start PostgreSQL, so instead run:
```
lunchy start postgres
```


**5. Install Elasticsearch**

Where would we be without search? The app uses ElasticSearch which is a search server - quite simply it’s going to help you find posts and users in the app.

```
brew install elasticsearch
```

Start Elasticsearch:
```
elastic search —config=/usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml
```

Lets check it is running by visiting [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200) in your browser. You should get something like this:

```
{
  “status” : 200,
  “name” : “Atalanta”,
  “cluster_name” : “elasticsearch_kenhibino”,
  “version” : {
    “number” : “1.7.3”,
    “build_hash” : “05d4530971ef0ea46d0f4fa6ee64dbc8df659682”,
    “build_timestamp” : “2015-10-15T09:14:17Z”,
    “build_snapshot” : false,
    “lucene_version” : “4.10.4”
  },
  “tagline” : “You Know, for Search”
}
```

**6. Install Redis**

Using Homebrew install Redis and then start the server:

```
brew install redis
redis-server
```

**7. Clone the app**

Browse to where you want the app to live and clone app:

```
git clone https://github.com/kenny-hibino/stories.git
```

Change directory into the stories folder
```
cd stories
```


**8. Start the app**

First install all the required gems:
```
bundle install
```

Execute Sidekiq, ElasticSearch and Mailer
```
bundle exec sidekiq -q elastic search -q mailer -c 3
```

Set up and migrate the database:
```
rake db:setup
rake db:migrate
```

Create Index with elasticsearch
```

rake es:recreate_index
```

Lets run the App:
```
rails server
```

Then browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in all its glory. Wait where is that “Hello World!” moment? Time to create the admin account so we can create some posts…

**9. Create an Admin account**

Enter the rails console:

```
rails console
```

Add a new user account replacing your email and password:

```
Admin.create(email: ‘your@email.com’, password: ‘password’, password_confirmation: ‘password’)
```

Close the console:

```
exit
```

Navigate to the Admin dashboard and enter your email and password:

[http://localhost:3000/admins/sign_in](http://localhost:3000/admins/sign_in)

You can now...
- Write new posts
- Feature tags by clicking on the “feature” button when on a tag pages
